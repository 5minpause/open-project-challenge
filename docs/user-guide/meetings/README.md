# Meeting management

Meetings in OpenProject allow you to manage and document your project meetings at one central place, prepare a meeting agenda together with your team and document and share meeting minutes with your meeting attendees at one central place.

<div class="glossary">
**Meetings** is defined as a module that allows the organization of meetings. The module has to be activated in the [Project Settings](../projects/project-settings/modules/) in order to be displayed in the side navigation.
