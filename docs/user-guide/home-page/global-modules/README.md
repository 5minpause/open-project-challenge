> It is possible that some of the global modules are not displayed for you. This will be the case if said module is not activated in the Project settings (LINK) of any of the projects in you instance. If for example **News** module is not enabled for any of the projects, you will not see it in the **Global modules** menu. 

## Projects

**Projects** global module will display a list of the projects that exist in your OpenProject instance, which you are a member of and/or have the right to see (for example as an admin) and public projects.

You can create a new project here directly by using the  **+ Project** button at the bottom of the sidebar.

On the left you will have the following options:

**All projects** is the default view and shows only active projects. If you do not have admin rights, this view will be the same as **My projects** for you.

**My projects** is the view that will show projects you are a member of and public projects you are not a member of. When this menu entry is selected, an **I am member** filter will be activated under Filters. You can then add various other filters to adjust the view.
