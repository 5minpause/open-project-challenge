# OneDrive integration (Enterprise add-on)


You can use **OneDrive/SharePoint** as an integrated file storage in OpenProject.

This integration makes it possible for you to:
- Link files and folders stored in OneDrive/SharePoint with work packages in OpenProject

- View, open and download files and folders linked to a work package via the **Files** tab

- View all work packages linked to a file IS THIS TRUE FOR ONEDRIVE?

> **Note**: OneDrive/SharePoint integration is an Enterprise add-on and can only be used with [Enterprise cloud](../../enterprise-guide/enterprise-cloud-guide/) or [Enterprise on-premises](../../enterprise-guide/enterprise-on-premises-guide/). An upgrade from the free Community edition is easy and helps support OpenProject.

> **Important note**: To be able to use OneDrive/SharePoint as a file storage in your project, the administrator of your instance should first have completed the [OneDrive/SharePoint integration setup](../../../system-admin-guide/integrations/onedrive). Then a project administrator can activate Nextcloud in the  [**File storages**](../../projects/project-settings/file-storages/) for a project.

## Connect your OpenProject and OneDrive/SharePoint accounts

To begin using this integration, you will need to first connect your  OpenProject and OneDrive accounts. To do this, open any work package in a project where a OneDrive/SharePoint file storage has been added and enabled by  an administrator and follow these steps:

1. Go to the Files tab and, under the “SharePoint” header, click on **Storage login**.

2. You will see a Microsoft OneDrive screen asking you to log in. Enter your credentials and log in. 

3. Once you have logged in, you will automatically return to the work package in OpenProject and see that you can now start uploading and linking files.
