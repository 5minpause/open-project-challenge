# OneDrive integration (Enterprise add-on)


Starting with OpenProject 13.1, you can use **OneDrive/SharePoint** as an integrated file storage in OpenProject.

This integration makes it possible for you to:
- Link files and folders stored in OneDrive/SharePoint with work packages in OpenProject

- View, open and download files and folders linked to a work package via the **Files** tab

- View all work packages linked to a file IS THIS TRUE FOR ONEDRIVE?

> **Note**: OneDrive/SharePoint integration is an Enterprise add-on and can only be used with [Enterprise cloud](../../enterprise-guide/enterprise-cloud-guide/) or [Enterprise on-premises](../../enterprise-guide/enterprise-on-premises-guide/). An upgrade from the free Community edition is easy and helps support OpenProject.

> **Important note**: To be able to use Sharepoint as a file storage in your project, the administrator of your instance should first have completed the [OneDrive/SharePoint integration setup](../../system-admin-guide/integrations/onedrive). Then a project administrator can activate Nextcloud in the  [**File storages**](../projects/project-settings/file-storages/) for a project.
