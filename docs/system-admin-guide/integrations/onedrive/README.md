### Add a OneDrive/SharePoint storage to a project (Enterprise add-on)

> **Note**: OneDrive/SharePoint integration is an Enterprise add-on and can only be used with [Enterprise cloud](../../../enterprise-guide/enterprise-cloud-guide/) or [Enterprise on-premises](../../../enterprise-guide/enterprise-on-premises-guide/). An upgrade from the free Community edition is easy and helps support OpenProject.

OpenProject offers an integration with OneDrive/Sharepoint to allow users to:

- Link files and folders stored in OneDrive/Sharepoint with OpenProject work packages
- View, open and download files and folder linked to a work package via the Files tab
- View all work packages linked to a file

> Note: This guide only covers the integration setup. Please go to our [OneDrive/Sharepoint integration user guide](../../../user-guide/nextcloud-integration/) to learn more about how to work with the OneDrive/Sharepoint integration.

## Minimum requirements

Please note these minimum version requirements for the integration to work with a minimal feature set:

- OpenProject version 13.1 (or above)
- Access to OneDrive/SharePoint

We recommend using the latest versions of both OneDrive/Sharepoint and OpenProject to be able to use the latest features. 

## Set up the integration

> **Important**: You need to have administrator privileges in both your OneDrive/SharePoint and OpenProject instances to set up this integration.

Navigate to **System administration -> File storages**.
